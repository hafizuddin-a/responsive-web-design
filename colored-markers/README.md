## What I learned
I learned how to use different methods of defining colors in CSS, including color names, hexadecimal codes, RGB values, HSL values, and CSS variables. I also learned how to create color gradients using linear-gradient and radial-gradient functions. I also learned to use box-shadow to property to add depth to elements, making them appear more three-dimensional. By the end of the course, I was able to create a set of realistic and colorful markers.
