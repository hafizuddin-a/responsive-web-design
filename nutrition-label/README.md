## Things I learned
I learned how to use typography to make my web page more attractive and user-friendly. I learned how to use different font properties to change the typeface, size, weight, style, and spacing of the text. I also learned how to use text properties to align, transform, decorate, and adjust the text. By the end of the course, I was able to create a nutrition label that displayed the information clearly and legibly.
