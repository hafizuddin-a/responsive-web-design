## What I learned
 I learned how to use CSS flexbox to create flexible and responsive layouts. I learned how to use various flexbox properties to control the behavior, alignment, and size of flex items. By the end of the course, I was able to create a photo gallery that displayed different numbers of images per row depending on the screen size.
