## What I learned
I learned how to use HTML tags to give a webpage its structure and content. I learned how to add photos, buttons, and other elements to my webpage using HTML tags. I also learned how to use HTML attributes to customize my elements, such as adding links, alt text, and placeholders. I learned how to nest elements inside other elements, and how to use comments to make my code more readable. By completing this lesson, I learned the basics of HTML and how to create a simple webpage.
