## What I learned
I learned how to use HTML forms to collect user input on my web page. I learned how to use different types of form elements, such as text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown menus. I also learned how to organize and label my form elements using labels, fieldsets, legends, and placeholders. By the end of the course, I was able to create a registration form that collected user information.
