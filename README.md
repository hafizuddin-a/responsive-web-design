# Responsive web design
## Concepts I learnt
1. **Responsive web design (RWD)** is the practice of designing web pages that look good and function well on a variety of devices, from desktop computers to smartphones. RWD is important because it ensures that your web pages are accessible to everyone, regardless of the device they are using.
2. **Media queries** are used to control how a web page is displayed on different devices. They allow you to specify different CSS styles for different screen widths. For example, you could use a media query to specify that a certain CSS style should be applied to a web page when the screen width is less than 768px.
3. **Fluid layouts** are designed to adapt to the width of the browser window. They use percentages instead of fixed pixel values, so they can be resized without breaking. This is important for RWD, as it ensures that your web pages will look good on a variety of devices with different screen widths.
4. **Bootstrap** is a popular CSS framework that makes it easy to create responsive web pages. It includes a number of pre-built components and classes that can be used to create responsive layouts. Bootstrap is a great way to get started with RWD, as it provides a lot of the basic functionality that you need.
5. **Typography** is the art of arranging type. It is important for creating readable and visually appealing web pages. There are a number of factors to consider when designing typography for the web, such as font size, line height, and font weight.
6. **Accessibility** is the practice of making web pages accessible to people with disabilities. This includes using clear and concise language, providing alternative text for images, and making sure that all functionality can be accessed using a keyboard. Accessibility is important for ensuring that everyone can use your web pages, regardless of their abilities.
7. **CSS variables** are a way to store values in CSS that can be reused throughout a web page. This can be useful for keeping your CSS code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and for making your web pages more dynamic.
8. **CSS Grid** is a new layout system in CSS that allows you to create complex layouts with ease. It is a powerful tool for creating responsive web pages, as it allows you to define the layout of a web page in terms of rows and columns.
9. **Flexbox** is another new layout system in CSS that is similar to CSS Grid. It is a bit simpler to use than CSS Grid, but it is not as powerful. Flexbox is a good choice for creating simple responsive layouts.
