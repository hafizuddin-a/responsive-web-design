## What I learned
I learned how to use CSS to style my web page. I learned how to use different CSS properties to change the color, size, margin, padding, background, font, and alignment of HTML elements. I also learned how to use class selectors and pseudo-classes to target specific elements based on their attributes or states. By the end of the course, I was able to create a cafe menu that looked professional and responsive
